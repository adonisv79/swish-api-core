Welcome to the project. This project is free for all to use and improve on. 
For anyone who wants to contribute, just email me at adonisv79@gmail.com

Please note that changes will have to go thru proper code review and requires pull requests to be made. This may take time as I can operate only on weekends. As such, you may also just fork the repo to implement your changes faster.
